	<p>My mom has been making this recipe ever since I can remember. Recently I decided to take a crack at it myself, and came up with a few modifications that I think make it even better. Let's get started!</p>

	<h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
    	<li>Cube your chicken. Salt it, season it with a sprinkle of each of the seasonings listed above as well as a splash of lime juice. Make sure the chicken is fully covered in seasoning. Set aside in a bowl or Ziplock bag while you chop the veggies.</li>
        <li>Heat a large skillet over medium heat and add neutral-flavored oil. When the oil shimmers, add the chicken. When it's nearly cooked through, remove from heat and set aside on a plate or in a bowl.</li>
        <li>Add more oil to the skillet (if needed). Add the onions and cook until blonde, about 8-10 minutes. Then, add the garlic and cook until fragrant but not brown, about 20 seconds.</li>
        <li>Add the peppers and squash and cook until they begin to soften, about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Now add the drained corn and beans and the undrained diced or fire-roasted tomatoes. Season everything generously to taste.</li>
        <li>When the veggies are soft, add the chicken back into the pot. Squeeze a few tablespoons of lime juice over everything.</li>
        <li>Cover and simmer for 10+ minutes, until the veggies are tender and the chicken is cooked.</li>
        <li>Adjust seasoning.</li>
        <li>Serve with fresh salsa on warm tortillas; cheese optional.</li>
   </ol>
